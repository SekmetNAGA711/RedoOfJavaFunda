        end of the body is reached on a while loop, the program will go back up to the top and check the condition again.
        If it's true, it will run the body again and it will keep repeating this until the condition is false. At which point
         it will stop looping and simply skip the body and continue. So whereas an if statement will only run once a while,
          loop can run many times.
